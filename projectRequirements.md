Feature Selection Using Genetic Algorithms to Train Decision Trees.
o Identify a publicly available dataset (e.g., for diagnosing diseases).
o Define an objective function for feature selection that maximises classification accuracy while
reducing feature count (i.e., training a decision tree).
o Implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) where each individual represents a feature subset.
o Run experiments comparing different selection and crossover strategies on the dataset.
o Summarise findings with charts, accuracy metrics, and a final report.
Detailed Description:
Context and Problem Statement: In machine learning, reducing the number of features can simplify models
and improve performance. Selecting the best features is critical for accurate diagnosis.
Key Terms and Concepts:
o Feature Selection: The process of choosing a subset of relevant features (variables) for model
training.
o Genetic Algorithm (GA): An algorithm that evolves candidate solutions using techniques inspired
by biological evolution.
Requirements/Deliverables:
o A GA implementation for selecting a meaningful subset of the dataset features.
o A detailed comparison of different GA operators (selection, crossover, mutation).
o Performance metrics (accuracy, reduction percentage) across multiple runs.
o A comprehensive report with visual aids (graphs and tables) showing algorithm performance.
